# Node.js Toolbox Catalog

This repository houses the categories and libraries used by [Node.js Toolbox](https://nodejstoolbox.com).

**Want to add a category or missing a library?** Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add a library in the appropriate category and create a pull request. If you're not sure which category a library belongs to, you can open an issue instead.

You'll find the categories in the `./src/categories` folder. Each category is a json file with a `packages` array containing all libraries belonging to that specific category.
